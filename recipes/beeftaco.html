        <h3>Beef Taco</h3>
        <div>
            <p>The Taco was first introduced to the United States in 1905. Mexican migrants were coming in to work on railroads and other jobs and started to bring their delicious food with them. Tacos were essentially a street food at this time since they were highly portable and cheap.</p>

            <h4><em>TIPS</em></h4>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Create a small condiment bar to serve alongside your easy ground beef tacos: in addition to the lettuce, tomato and cheese, set out small bowls of chopped avocado, sliced radishes, sweet bell pepper, additional salsa and fresh cilantro.</em></li>
                <li><em>Turn these Easy Beef Tacos into taco bowls by spooning the salsa-seasoned beef onto a bed of shredded lettuce, topped with the tomatoes and cheese. Sprinkle with crushed tortilla chips for added crunch.</em></li>
                <li><em>Look for shredded Mexican cheese blends where you’d find the Cheddar cheese—they’re a mix of Cheddar, Monterey Jack, Colby, and sometimes a sprinkle of mild chili powder.</em></li>
                <li><em>Try switching up this simple ground beef taco recipe by using ground chicken or ground turkey instead.</em></li>
            </ul>
