# odin-recipes
A page about recipes.
This is my very first webpage that I have made from the bottom up. Despite the "nakedness" and simplicity of the page(s), I am very proud and happy that I managed to do all of it without major help from resources.

I do have some previous knowledge and experience with HTML, however, it was been quite a while since it was used. Therefore, I am extremely proud of what I managed to do. 
This project gave me several ideas for future projects (i.e., my girlfriend loves to cook and bake things, perhaps I could make her a page with all her recipes!). 
Furthermore, I realized that this process is very repetitive and it is an advantage to be a fast typer. Also, there is an advantage in knowing keyboard shortcuts and having a good setup that allows for organization.
